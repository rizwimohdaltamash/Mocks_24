      options: [
        "a) var is the oldest way to declare a variable in JavaScript. Variables declared with var have a function-level scope, meaning they are only accessible within the function in which they were declared. They also have hoisting behavior, which means they are accessible throughout the entire scope of the function, regardless of where they were declared. However, because of its function-level scope, variables declared with var can lead to unexpected behavior and are generally not recommended.",
        "b) let was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (also known as ES6) as an alternative to var. Variables declared with let have the block-level scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block in which they were declared. They also have the concept of the temporal dead zone, which means they are not accessible before they are declared.",
        "c) const was also introduced in ECMAScript 6 and is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned. This makes const variables useful for declaring constants, such as pi or the gravitational constant, which have a fixed value. Like let, const variables have the block-level scope, and, they are not accessible before they are declared.",
