        "2) What is the main component of the JavaScript engine, and how does it work?",
      options: [
        "a) Call Queue and Execution Thread: The Call Queue stores the list of functions waiting to be executed, while the Execution Thread is responsible for executing these functions in a parallel manner.",
        "b) Call Stack and a Heap: The Call Stack is where our code gets executed with the help of the Execution Context. And the Heap is an Unstructured Memory Pool that stores all the objects in the memory that our application needs.",
        "c) Global Execution Context and Task Queue: The Global Execution Context handles the execution of global code, while the Task Queue manages the tasks waiting for execution after asynchronous operations.",
        "d) Event Loop and Callback Stack: The Event Loop processes asynchronous callbacks, while the Callback Stack stores the functions that need to be executed after the main execution is complete.",

        "3) What is Event Loop in Javascript and how it helps in asynchronous programming?",
      options: [
        "a) Event loop is a part of the JavaScript engine that executes synchronous code first, then asynchronous code in a parallel thread.",
        "b) Event loop is a built-in method in JavaScript that allows you to loop through events in an array asynchronously.",
        "c) Event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that directly controls the execution of promises and makes them run faster.",
        "d) Event loop manages the Asynchronous operations and ensures that they are executed in a Non-Blocking manner, without creating new threads. This allows JavaScript to remain single-threaded while still handling asynchronous tasks efficiently.",

      question:
        "4) Which of the following statements accurately describes the nature of const, let, var?",
      options: [
        "a) var is the oldest way to declare a variable in JavaScript. Variables declared with var have a function-level scope, meaning they are only accessible within the function in which they were declared. They also have hoisting behavior, which means they are accessible throughout the entire scope of the function, regardless of where they were declared. However, because of its function-level scope, variables declared with var can lead to unexpected behavior and are generally not recommended.",
        "b) let was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (also known as ES6) as an alternative to var. Variables declared with let have the block-level scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block in which they were declared. They also have the concept of the temporal dead zone, which means they are not accessible before they are declared.",
        "c) const was also introduced in ECMAScript 6 and is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned. This makes const variables useful for declaring constants, such as pi or the gravitational constant, which have a fixed value. Like let, const variables have the block-level scope, and, they are not accessible before they are declared.",

        "a) Callback functions are functions passed as arguments to other functions and executed after the completion of a task.",
        "b) Callback Hell refers to the situation where callbacks are nested within other callbacks multiple levels deep. This makes the code hard to read, maintain, and debug.",

      "b) async: A function declared with the 'async' keyword automatically returns a promise. Within an 'async' function,you can use the 'await' keyboard. || await: The 'await' keyword pauses the execution of the 'async' function until the promise it is waiting for is resolved or rejected.",
      "c) async: A function declared with the 'async' keyword must always be followed by a 'then' statement. || await: The 'await' keyword allows a promise to be ignored and skipped.",
